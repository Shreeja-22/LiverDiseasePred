# Prediction of Liver Diseases using Classification Techniques

Liver diseases encompass a spectrum of conditions, ranging from mild inflammation to severe complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. These ailments can arise from various factors including viral infections, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, autoimmune disorders, and genetic predispositions.

Given the diverse etiology and the potential severity of liver diseases, early detection and intervention are paramount. Predictive classification techniques offer promising avenues for identifying individuals at risk and facilitating timely interventions. By leveraging machine learning algorithms on comprehensive datasets encompassing clinical, genetic, and lifestyle factors, we can enhance our ability to predict, diagnose, and manage liver diseases effectively.

In this notebook, we explore the application of classification techniques in predicting liver diseases using the **Indian Liver Patient Records (ILPD) Dataset**, aiming to improve outcomes through proactive healthcare strategies.
